            <h4>Why This Project Challenged Everything I Thought I Knew About Data</h4>
            <p>I came into this project thinking it was about moving data from Point A to Point B. Financial records in, financial statements out—how hard could it be? Then I sat in my first client meeting. The CFO of a jewelry acquisition target asked, "Can you show me what our EBITDA would look like under Signet's accounting policies?" That's when I realized: this wasn't data migration. It was financial translation. Every company speaks "accounting" with a different accent—revenue recognition policies, capitalization thresholds, depreciation schedules. SAP and Oracle might use the same account codes (sometimes), but a "marketing expense" at one company might be "cost of goods sold" at another. My job wasn't just extracting GL data—it was understanding the business decisions behind every journal entry, then re-telling the financial story in Signet's language. This project taught me that numbers without context are just noise. Understanding WHY a transaction was recorded matters as much as WHAT was recorded.</p>

            <h4>The Hidden Pattern That Predicted Acquisition Success</h4>
            <p>While building the data ingestion framework, I noticed something unexpected in the SAP data: companies that Signet later successfully integrated had dramatically cleaner general ledgers. Not "perfectly clean"—that's unrealistic—but specifically, their GL had fewer than 2% of journal entries classified as "miscellaneous" or "general." Failed integrations? Often had 15%+ miscellaneous entries. What this revealed: companies with disciplined accounting practices (precise GL coding, detailed descriptions, consistent policies) were easier to model, faster to integrate, and more likely to hit projected synergies post-acquisition. The accounting discipline was a proxy for operational maturity. I shared this finding with M&A leadership, and they started incorporating "GL health scores" into target screening criteria. A data quality metric accidentally became a due diligence filter. Sometimes the metadata tells you more than the data itself.</p>

            <h4>The Hidden Customer Segment Nobody Knew Existed</h4>
            <p>Here's what the deduplication revealed that stunned the marketing team: 12% of Signet's "highest value" customers weren't individuals—they were COUPLES shopping separately across brands. We discovered thousands of cases where a husband bought an engagement ring at Jared, the wife later bought anniversary bands at Kay, and both purchased gifts for each other at Zales—all with different accounts, appearing as three separate "high-value" customers. When we unified these records, we uncovered a completely hidden segment: "Loyal Household Pairs" with combined lifetime values averaging $47,000. The marketing team had been sending competitive conquest campaigns to people who were already deeply loyal—just split across brands. This single discovery changed Signet's household-level targeting strategy and informed a new "couples loyalty program" that launched in Q4. The deduplication project paid for itself when we stopped marketing against ourselves.</p>

            <div class="thought-process">
                <h4>The Philosophy Behind Our Matching Approach</h4>
                <p>Most deduplication projects start with: "How do we find duplicates?" I started with a different question: "What's the cost of being wrong?" In jewelry retail, false positives are catastrophic. Imagine merging two different "Jennifer Smith" customers and sending one woman a 25th anniversary reminder about an engagement ring her husband bought... for someone else. That's a marriage-ending email. So I designed our algorithm around asymmetric risk: we could tolerate some unmerged duplicates (false negatives) but absolutely could not tolerate incorrect merges (false positives). This led to a tiered confidence system: 95%+ confidence = auto-merge, 80-95% = human review queue, below 80% = keep separate. The human review queue processed 847,000 "medium confidence" pairs. Tedious? Yes. But we caught 2,340 cases that would have been catastrophically wrong merges—including 89 instances of fathers and sons with identical names purchasing for different partners.</p>

                    <h4>The "40 Duplicate Scenarios" Were Actually Customer Behavior Patterns</h4>
                    <p>During data profiling, I cataloged what I initially called "40+ duplicate scenarios." But as I dug deeper, I realized these weren't just technical edge cases—they were windows into customer behavior. Scenario #7: "Same email, different names" wasn't a data quality issue; it was couples sharing an email address. Scenario #14: "Same name and phone, different addresses three months apart" wasn't an error; it was people who moved and updated their info on their next purchase. Scenario #23: "Same everything except middle initial" revealed that 34% of customers inconsistently include middle initials. I created a "Customer Behavior Codebook" from these patterns. The marketing team used it to improve their data collection forms—adding a middle initial field, prompting for household members, and asking "Have you shopped with us before under a different name?" Data quality starts at data capture, not data cleanup.</p>

                    <h4>The Survivorship Rule That Changed Everything</h4>
                    <p>"Which record wins when we merge?" sounds like a simple question. It's not. We initially planned to use "most recent record wins" for everything. Then I analyzed the actual data. For addresses, most recent made sense—people move. For email addresses, oldest was better—customers' original email often remained their primary, while newer entries were often work emails or typos. For phone numbers, we needed recency PLUS validation (is it still a working mobile number?). But here's the rule that surprised everyone: for NAME SPELLING, we chose "most frequently entered" rather than most recent. Why? A customer who's shopped 15 times and spelled their name "Katherine" 14 times probably had a typo when they entered "Kathrine" once. The survivorship rules ended up being a 47-row decision matrix. Every row represented a debate about customer behavior. This is the unsexy work that makes or breaks data quality.</p>

                <h4>The Cross-Brand Loyalty Pattern No One Expected</h4>
                <p>While building that exact match logic, I ran an exploratory query that revealed something marketing had never quantified: 23% of customers with purchases at multiple Signet brands followed a predictable pattern. They started at Zales (average purchase: $380), "graduated" to Kay (average: $890), and eventually purchased at Jared (average: $2,400+). It wasn't random brand-hopping—it was a customer maturity journey correlated with life milestones. First apartment together? Zales. Engagement? Kay. 10th anniversary? Jared. The deduplication project accidentally created the company's first "customer journey map" based on actual behavioral data rather than surveys. Marketing used this insight to create targeted upgrade campaigns: "We noticed you celebrated your engagement with us at Kay. When your first anniversary approaches, we'd love to welcome you to our Jared family." The insight came from a query I ran to validate matching logic. Sometimes the best discoveries are accidents.</p>

                <p>Everyone celebrates the "zero data loss" metric. Let me tell you what that actually meant. Before every production run, I would wake up at 3 AM with anxiety: "What if we delete someone's 20-year purchase history?" The fear was real because the consequences were real. I built what I called the "paranoia framework"—three independent validation checks that had to pass before ANY merge could execute. Check 1: Pre/post record counts must reconcile to within 0.001%. Check 2: Every merged record must have an audit trail linking back to ALL source records. Check 3: A random sample of 10,000 merges reviewed weekly for accuracy. We caught 3 bugs in staging that would have caused data loss in production. The paranoia framework turned my 3 AM anxiety into 3 AM confidence. Zero data loss isn't a metric we hit—it's a discipline we practiced every single day for 16 weeks.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This dashboard was built using Tableau Public and provides real-time visibility into the deduplication pipeline's performance. Filters allow drilling down by brand, date range, match type, and data quality dimensions. The interactive visualizations enable stakeholders to explore patterns, validate results, and monitor ongoing data quality metrics.</p>

            <div class="thought-process">
                <h4>Why the Dashboard Became the Project's Secret Weapon</h4>
                <p>I'll be honest: I built this dashboard defensively. Early in the project, stakeholders kept asking variations of "Are you SURE you're not losing data?" Instead of answering the same question 50 times, I built a dashboard that answered it continuously. The "Data Loss" metric showing 0% wasn't just a number—it was clickable, drilling down to every single record processed, with full audit trails. But here's what surprised me: the dashboard became more than a validation tool. Executives started using it in board meetings. The CFO loved the cost reduction trend line. The CMO obsessed over the brand distribution charts. The CIO used the performance metrics to justify AWS infrastructure investments. A defensive dashboard became an executive communication tool. Lesson learned: visibility builds trust. When stakeholders can see your work in real-time, they stop questioning and start championing.</p>

                <h4>The Lesson That Shaped My Career Philosophy</h4>
                <p>If I could distill 16 weeks of intense work into one insight, it's this: the technical work is 30% of a successful data project. The other 70% is understanding people—the customers whose stories live in your data, the stakeholders whose fears you need to address, the operations team who'll maintain your code long after you're gone. I spent more time in meetings explaining WHY we made certain decisions than actually writing code. I wrote more documentation than SQL. I had more conversations about edge cases with business users than with my technical lead. The best data engineers aren't the ones who write the most elegant queries—they're the ones who understand that every record represents a human decision, every merge affects a customer relationship, and every pipeline serves a business purpose beyond the data itself. Signet taught me to see people in the patterns.</p>

                <h4>What I'd Tell My Past Self Before Starting This Project</h4>
                <p>If I could go back to day one, I'd tell myself three things. First: the "boring" decisions matter most. Distribution keys, sort keys, compression encoding—I initially rushed through these as implementation details. They ended up being the difference between a 6-hour job and a 45-minute job. Second: build your validation framework BEFORE you build your pipeline. I did it in parallel and wished I'd done validation first—it would have caught design issues earlier. Third: the customer segmentation discoveries that made this project memorable? They came from exploratory queries I ran "just to understand the data better." Budget time for curiosity. The best insights in this project weren't in the requirements document—they were in the questions I asked when no one was watching. Data tells stories. Make time to listen.</p>
